## Collect your data
Conduct an experiment involving a change in one of conditions in order to measure and collect data. You could:
  - Place your Raspberry Pi in the fridge and record the ambient temperature. What happens when you open the door? How quickly does the temperature inside the fridge return to normal?
  - Drop your Raspberry Pi from a height and track the changes in orientation and acceleration (ensure you protect your Raspberry Pi carefully before dropping it)
  - Send your Raspberry Pi high into the atmosphere using a high-altitude balloon and explore the changes in temperature, pressure, and humidity throughout the flight.
