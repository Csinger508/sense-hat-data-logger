## Sense HAT Data Logger

During the Astro Pi mission, a pair of Raspberry Pis with Sense HATs attached will be capturing and logging a range of data about life on board the International Space Station.

In this activity you will use a Raspberry Pi, a Sense HAT and some Python code to create your own datalogging tool, which you can use to capture interesting data and perform experiments.

In preparation for this resource, attach your Sense HAT to your Raspberry Pi and install the software by following this [guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-guide/assemble.md).
