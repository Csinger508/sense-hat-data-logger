## Collect your data

Use your Python code to record data over a long period of time at an interval of your choice, such as:
- Measure the temperature, humidity and pressure of a room in your house every five minutes (i.e. every 300 seconds) over the period of a week.
- Monitoring conditions for plant growth inside a propagator or greenhouse: measure conditions which may impact on the health of the plants.

##What next
  - Use your data logging code to explore conditions on the ISS following our [Sensing Science](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/sensing-space) activity.
