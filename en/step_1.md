## What you will make
In this activity, you will learn how to use the Sense HAT hardware to build a data logging device which can capture a range of information about its immediate environment.

The Python program you write will mimic the function of a program being run by British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake as part of the Astro Pi project. While on board the International Space Station, Tim will be using the same hardware to log environmental condition and motion.

Once you've created your data logger you will be able to use it to conduct your own experiments and record data. Things we've tried include:

- Dropping the data logger from a four-storey building
- Putting our data logger in a fridge and observing temperature changes
- Sending the hardware to the edge of space with a helium balloon.

## What you will learn
By creating a Sense HAT datalogger with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to collect data from multiple sensors and build it into a list structure.
- To write and append data to a text file from within a Python program.
- To capture and respond to input from the Sense HAT joystick.
- About using threads to allow multiple parts of a program to run at once.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):
