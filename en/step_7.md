## Sense HAT Data Logger - Part 2

In the first part of this activity, you built a data logger that logs all data from the Sense HAT as often as it can and starts when your Raspberry Pi starts. If you follow this worksheet, you'll be able to extend your data logger to add some optional features such as:

  - Being able to select which data your program logs from the Sense-HAT
  - Adding the ability to log data at a fixed interval (every ten seconds for example)
