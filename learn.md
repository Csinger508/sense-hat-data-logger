By creating a Sense HAT datalogger with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to collect data from multiple sensors and build it into a list structure.
- To write and append data to a text file from within a Python program.
- To capture and respond to input from the Sense HAT joystick.
- About using threads to allow multiple parts of a program to run at once.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/developer)
- [Process input data to monitor or react to the environment](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/developer)
